SpartanMart is an Android application that allows members of the San Jose State University (SJSU) community to buy and sell their goods. Access to the application is restricted upon registration by requiring a SJSU email. All user, product, and transaction information are maintained by a database. Furthermore, payments will be authorized and processed by a trusted third party payment gateway. Users will be able to post goods they want to sell, or search and preview desired goods and then proceed to meet with the seller and purchase the goods if desired. Buyers will also be able to rate and review a seller.
